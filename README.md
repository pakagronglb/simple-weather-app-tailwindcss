# simple-weather-app-tailwindcss
This is a very simple demo of a weather app with responsive features with the help of Tailwind CSS.

# Approach
- Create a basic HTML structure and then link the Tailwind CSS CDN link.
- Then apply Tailwind CSS utility classes to style the UI components for that use some classes like bg-white, p-8, “rounded-md”, “shadow-lg”, “w-full”, “h-auto”, etc. for background color, padding, layout, spacing, shadows, width, height, and styling.
- Then you can add some FontAwesome icons to make the UI user-friendly.
- Use JavaScript to add functionality to the Weather App. And use event listeners to handle form submissions. Fetch weather data from an API based on the entered city name.
- Then dynamically display the weather information obtained from the API response.
